# R: problems, pitfalls, and opportunities

This repository contains the R-markdown source code and other requirements to build a powerpoint presentation about various R aspects, features, and quirks.

Knitting is intended to use a WUR template. This template is not in the repository due to potential copyright issues. Knitting with the included 'test' template should work as a placeholder.

After knitting the PPT still needs some cleaning up, mostly to curate code formatting (e.g. changing line spacing and font size).

Knitting from the commandline: `R -e 'rmarkdown::render("friday_lecture.Rmd")'` (this requires pandoc!).
